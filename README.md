Face detection applications use AI algorithms, ML, statistical analysis and image processing to find human faces within larger images and distinguish them from nonface objects such as landscapes, buildings and other human body parts. Before face detection begins, the analyzed media is preprocessed to improve its quality and remove images that might interfere with detection.

Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human eyes, one of the easiest features to detect. They then try to detect facial landmarks, such as eyebrows, mouth, nose, nostrils and irises. Once the algorithm concludes that it has found a facial region, it does additional tests to confirm that it has detected a face.
